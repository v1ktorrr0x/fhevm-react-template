# Requirements Document: FHECounter UI/UX Modernization

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing the FHECounter frontend demo's user interface and user experience. The focus is purely on visual design, interaction patterns, and component structure - no changes to business logic, hooks, or SDK integration. The modernization will create a modular, component-based UI architecture with a flush, contemporary design system while maintaining Zama's brand identity.

## Glossary

- **UI Component**: A self-contained, reusable visual element with defined props and styling
- **Design System**: A collection of reusable UI components, patterns, and visual guidelines
- **Glassmorphism**: A design style using frosted glass effects with backdrop blur and transparency
- **Zama Brand**: The visual identity including black backgrounds, yellow (#FED209) accents, and sharp geometric design
- **Flush Design**: A modern, clean aesthetic with minimal borders, smooth transitions, and intentional whitespace
- **Visual Hierarchy**: The arrangement of elements to show their order of importance
- **Interaction State**: Visual feedback for user actions (hover, active, disabled, loading)
- **Responsive Design**: UI that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes

5. WHERE the counter value changes, THE Counter Display SHALL provide visual feedback within 300ms

### Requirement 5: Action Button Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive, responsive buttons so that I can easily interact with the counter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Button Component SHALL implement primary and secondary button variants
2. THE Button Component SHALL display loading states with spinner animations when processing
3. THE Button Component SHALL disable interactions when prerequisites are not met
4. THE Button Component SHALL provide hover feedback with scale transforms of 1.05
5. WHEN a button is clicked, THE Button Component SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the interface to adapt to my screen size so that I have an optimal viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Layout System SHALL support screen sizes from 320px to 2560px width
2. THE Layout System SHALL use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layouts
3. WHEN the viewport width is below 768px, THE Layout System SHALL stack components vertically
4. THE Layout System SHALL maintain readable text sizes across all breakpoints (minimum 14px)
5. WHERE horizontal space is limited, THE Layout System SHALL adjust padding and margins proportionally

### Requirement 7: Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want information organized logically so that I can quickly find what I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Information Architecture SHALL group related information into distinct sections
2. THE Information Architecture SHALL prioritize the counter display as the primary focal point
3. THE Information Architecture SHALL place system status information in a secondary, supporting position
4. THE Information Architecture SHALL organize contract information in a collapsible or separate section
5. WHERE multiple pieces of information are displayed, THE Information Architecture SHALL use visual hierarchy with size, color, and spacing

### Requirement 8: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the interface to be usable with assistive technologies so that I can interact with the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Accessibility System SHALL provide ARIA labels for all interactive elements
2. THE Accessibility System SHALL maintain color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for text
3. THE Accessibility System SHALL support keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
