# FHECounter UI Restructuring Summary

## Overview
Successfully restructured the FHECounter demo UI into a modern, two-column layout with improved visual hierarchy and user experience.

## New Layout Structure

### 1. Header (Full Width)
- **Logo + Title** on the left
- **Network Badge + Connect Button** on the right
- Responsive: stacks vertically on mobile

### 2. Main Content (Two-Column Grid)

#### Left Column (7/12 width on desktop)
**Counter Display - Hero Section**
- Massive counter value display (text-9xl)
- Encrypted handle information
- Three action buttons (Decrypt, Increment, Decrement)
- Primary focus of the interface
- Full width on mobile

#### Right Column (5/12 width on desktop)
**Status & Information Sidebar**

1. **System Status Card**
   - FHEVM Client status
   - Encryption readiness
   - Contract deployment status
   - Error messages (if any)
   - Stacked vertically for compact display

2. **Contract Info Card**
   - Contract address
   - Network information
   - User address
   - Compact, vertical layout

### 3. Features Section (Full Width Below)
- Three feature cards in a row
- Icons added for visual interest (üîß ‚ö° üõ°Ô∏è)

- Staggered entrance animations

## Key Improvements

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Counter display (largest, left column)

- Buttons stack vertically on small screens

### Spacing & Breathing Room
- Increased gaps between sections (gap-8)

- Consistent spacing throughout

### Visual Enhancements
