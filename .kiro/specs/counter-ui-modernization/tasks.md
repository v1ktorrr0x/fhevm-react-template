# Implementation Plan: FHECounter UI/UX Modernization

## Overview

This implementation plan modernizes the existing `FHECounterDemo.tsx` component by refactoring its visual design, improving styling organization, and enhancing user interactions. All changes are made directly to the existing file - no new files or component extraction needed.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
1. **Work directly in FHECounterDemo.tsx**: All changes are made to the existing component file
2. **Organize styles first**: Extract inline classes to named constants before making visual changes
3. **Test incrementally**: After each task, run the app and verify changes work correctly
4. **Preserve functionality**: Never modify hooks, state management, or business logic
5. **Use browser DevTools**: Test responsive design and animations in real-time

### Testing Strategy
- **Visual testing**: Check each section after updates using browser at different viewport sizes
- **Interaction testing**: Click buttons, hover over elements, test disabled states
- **Responsive testing**: Use browser DevTools device emulation (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Accessibility testing**: Use Lighthouse audit and keyboard navigation
- **Animation testing**: Use DevTools Performance tab to verify 60fps

### Success Criteria
- ✅ FHECounterDemo.tsx has organized, maintainable styling
- ✅ All existing functionality works identically (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Visual design is more polished and modern
- ✅ Animations run smoothly at 60fps
- ✅ Accessibility score >95 (Lighthouse)
- ✅ Mobile experience is improved
- ✅ Code has clear comments and documentation

### Quick Start
To begin implementation:
1. Start the development server: `pnpm start`
2. Open `packages/nextjs/app/_components/FHECounterDemo.tsx`
3. Start with Task 1: Refactor inline styles into organized constants
4. Test each change in the browser before moving to the next task
