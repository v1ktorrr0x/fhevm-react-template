# Product Overview

FHEVM React Template is a minimal React frontend template for building FHEVM-enabled decentralized applications (dApps).

## What is FHEVM?

FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) enables computation on encrypted data directly on Ethereum, allowing dApps to perform computations while keeping data private.

## Key Features

- Fully homomorphic encryption integration for privacy-preserving smart contracts
- React + Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS styling
- RainbowKit for wallet connection and management
- Multi-network support (Sepolia testnet and local Hardhat node)
- Monorepo structure with SDK, contracts, and frontend packages

## Target Use Case

This template demonstrates how to build dApps that interact with FHEVM smart contracts, specifically showcasing the `FHECounter.sol` contract as an example implementation.
