# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the FHE Counter application and provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### Smart Contract Security

#### Implemented Protections
- **Overflow/Underflow Protection**: All arithmetic operations are checked to prevent wrapping
- **Access Control**: Owner-based permissions for administrative functions
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency stop functionality for incident response
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated before processing
- **Event Logging**: All state changes emit events for transparency and monitoring

#### Security Measures
```solidity
// Overflow protection
ebool isOverflow = FHE.lt(newCount, _count);
FHE.req(FHE.not(isOverflow));

// Access control
modifier onlyOwner() {
    if (msg.sender != owner) revert Unauthorized();
    _;
}

// Pause mechanism
modifier whenNotPaused() {
    if (paused) revert ContractPaused();
    _;
}
```

### Frontend Security

#### Implemented Protections
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Timer-based locking prevents overlapping operations
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup on component unmount
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly messages

## Known Limitations

### Technical Constraints
1. **FHE Performance**: Encryption operations take 2-5 seconds (inherent to FHE technology)
2. **Gas Costs**: FHE operations are expensive (~195,000 gas per transaction)
3. **Network Support**: Currently supports Localhost and Sepolia only

### Security Considerations
1. **Demo Contract**: This is a demonstration contract - review thoroughly before production use
2. **No Formal Audit**: Contract has not undergone professional security audit
3. **Test Coverage**: Current test coverage is ~60% (target: 90%+)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email: security@example.com (replace with actual contact)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: 1 month

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security fixes will be released before public disclosure
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit private keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to mainnet
4. **Monitor events** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities

### For Users

1. **Verify contract address** before interacting
2. **Check transaction details** before signing
3. **Use hardware wallets** for significant amounts
4. **Be cautious of phishing** attempts
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## Audit History

### Internal Audits
- **October 27, 2025**: Comprehensive security review completed
  - All critical and high-severity issues resolved
  - Medium and low-severity issues documented

### External Audits
- **Status**: Not yet audited
- **Recommendation**: Professional audit required before mainnet deployment

## Security Checklist
