## Known Limitations

### Technical
1. **FHE Encryption Speed**
   - 2-5 seconds on Sepolia (inherent to FHE)
   - Cannot be significantly improved
   - Mitigation: Clear user feedback

2. **Gas Costs**
   - FHE operations are expensive (~195k gas)
   - Inherent to technology
   - Mitigation: Batch operations (Phase 2)

3. **Bundle Size**
   - ~850 KB (FHEVM SDK is large)
   - Mitigation: Code splitting (Phase 2)

### Functional
1. **Network Support**
   - Only Localhost and Sepolia
   - Easy to add more networks

2. **No Transaction History**
   - Users can't see past operations
   - Planned for Phase 3

3. **No Batch Operations**
   - One operation per transaction
   - Planned for Phase 2
